## Using Our Program:

The program will first ask you to select a shape for which the it would calculate the area. The options are:
 ```
 1	Rectangle
 2	Circle
 3	Triangle
 4	Square
 ```

Entering values from 1 to 4 would trigger a sub-menu. Any other input is invalid and the program would exit after that.

For Rectangle, you would be asked to enter the length of its sides.

For Circle, you would be asked to enter the radius of the circle.

For Triangle, you would be asked to enter the base and height of the triangle.

For Square, you would be asked to enter the length of its side.

All the number entered should be intergers or decimal numbers. No fraction or any other data types is acceptable; if such values are entered the program will exit showing an error message.
