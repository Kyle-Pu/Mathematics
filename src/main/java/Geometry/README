Coterminal Angles are angles which have have a difference of a multiple of 360

Examples:
1)45 and 405(difference of 360 degrees)
2)30 and 750(difference of 720)[720=360*2]

Coterminal Angles have the same results to Trigo operations performed on them

Examples:
1)sin(45)=1 and sin(405)=1
2)sin(30)=0.5 and sin(750)=0.5
