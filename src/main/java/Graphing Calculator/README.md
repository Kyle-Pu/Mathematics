## Graphing Calculator
Made by Daniel Binoy and Kyle Pu.

## Updates
Currently, the graphing window appears before the user inputs the necessary information. After inputting this info, the graphing window will update and display the correct results.

## To-Do List
- [x] Fix issue of scaling
- [ ] Change point size if scaling is too large
- [ ] Take input from a graphics window instead of the command line
- [ ] Let users choose the view with scrolling instead of fixing the mouse at the origin
- [ ] Create functionality to draw a line through the points
